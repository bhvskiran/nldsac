Write a program that uses the > operator to check if one number (a) is greater than another (b) and returns the result.

Example 1:

Input: a = 5, b = 3 
Output: true
Explanation: 
Example 2:

Input: a = -1, b = 2 
Output: false
Explanation: 
Example 3:

Input: a = 0, b = -1 
Output: true
Explanation: 
Example 4:

Input: a = -1000, b = -10000 
Output: true
Explanation: 
Constraints:

-10^5 <= a <= 10^5
-10^5 <= b <= 10^5
